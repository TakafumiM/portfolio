    <!-- Structure the different sections of content with <section> elements. 
        Think of <section> as the units of content that you would list in a table of contents for that page 
            (which is exactly how they are exposed to assistive technology users).

You may also find <article> useful for structuring independent, 
    self-contained units of content (“article” as in “article of clothing” not “newspaper article” 
    — yes, it is confusing!).

Elements you will need (excluding those outside <body>):

Headings, paragraphs, lists
<a> for links
<section> and <article> (see above)
<time> for dates
Elements you may need:

<header> for <section> or <article> headers that are more than just a heading
<img> in case you want to include icons or logos of organizations -->
